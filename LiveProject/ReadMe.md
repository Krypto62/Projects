<h1>Live Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
For my final project at The Tech Academy, I worked with a development team of my peers to add a Job Placement Board to 
Tech Academy's public facing website using C#. It was a great opportunity to jump in the middle of major project in progress
and see how the code was laid out, fix bugs and contribute addtional functionality to the code base. I was able to see
first-hand how an app can evolve over time and experience how collaboration via daily video "stand-ups" can really add to
the overall development of a quality product.</p>

<p>The Sprint I was a part of lasted two weeks, during which I was able to closely examine code and gain an understanding of
how various Models, Controllers and Views worked together to produce a robust website. I worked on a number of stories that I
am very proud of and have listed just a couple here below as examples.</p>
<h3>Sample Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>"On the JPStudents Index view, truncate the start date column to display mm/dd/yyyy without the time."</li>  
<li>"The JPStudents Index view needs to be responsive and mobile friendly."</li> 
<li>"On the JPChecklists Edit view, make sure the 'Back to List' button doesn't get cut off. The button
should maintain its alignment with the right side of the form."</li> 
</ul>
